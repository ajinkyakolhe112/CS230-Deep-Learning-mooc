Week 1 Lecture Notes: Beginning

- [ ] Welcome
- [ ] What is a NN
- [ ] Supervised Learning with NN
   1. Terms: Supervised Learning, Structured & Unstructured Data
   2. Wide Applications of NN
   3. Different types of NN Architecture: FC, CNN, RNN
- [ ] Why DL is taking Off?
   1. Solution Performance vs Human Understanding graph
      1. Increamental Knowledge
      2. Breakthrough Knowledge
      3. Better tools & technology
   2. Many Complex Problems, impossible to solve
      1. Not enough knowledge
      2. technology not advanced enough
   3. Solvable Performance
      1. Human Understanding
      2. Tools & Technology
      3. Without full understanding. (Easy Scale & Money & Profit)
         1. Amount of Data (Two multipliers)
         2. Complex Enough Model (Two multipliers)
         3. Can attempt complex problem, by just training for long time
         4. Once something works, it can be improved upon quite easily
   4. New Graph: Solvable Problems: (Complex Models, or Big Enough Data)
