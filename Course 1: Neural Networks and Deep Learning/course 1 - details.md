Deep Learning Landscape Meta Data
- Currently Hype phase
  - Too much supply but low quality
  - Demand on steady rise
- Harder than other fields because of Nascency
  - Default mastery is difficult anyways.
- Easier for innovation because of Nascency
  - Sigmoid to Relu. (Alexnet)
  - Use smaller kernel matrix size. (Vgg)
- Too much noise & too many influencers & 
- Multi disciplinary have advantage
- Wide Applicability. (General Purpose)
  - Not just ads or chatbots. But much much wider application
- At least Required as an essential side skill, if not a primary DL researcher
- New Economies
  - Video Special Effects

Simplify
- Fancy terms, simple meaning
- Engineering Discipline. Empirical Field, not like Physics

CS230
1. Comparison with other courses
   1. Kaggle Learn
   2. Udemy Practical Pytorch
   3. ERA1
   4. Udacity Pytorch
   5. sentdex NN from Scratch
2. Why:
   1. Reputed, On field experience Instructor
      1. Many Good courses on internet, but how many are actual Data Scientists?
   2. High Quality: (Stanford University)
   3. Past Student Projects for Comparison
   4. Open & Free: Unlike other expensive paid courses
3. But
   1. Difficult for beginners
      1. Numpy first, Tensorflow later
      2. Expects 
      3. Videos technically heavy 
      4. Not very interesting instructor, (spectrum of interesting but not knowledge vs others)
      5. less analogies & interesting examples to help understand better
      6. Less hands on tools for learning
   2. Misc
      1. Accent & Handwriting difficult to follow
      2. Not cutting edge slides or tools
         1. NN from Scratch in Python sentdex
         2. 3MathBrown
4. Improvements?
   1. Keras + Tensorflow Playground
   2. Keras -> Tensorflow -> Numpy Implementation. (Increamental Complexity)
   3. Spiral Learning of Same fundamental Building Block
5. Goal: 5 Courses
   1. CS230 Specialization
