## Learning Vlog. Learning as Project Management Aim. Certificate in 3 months.
1. ~~Why~~
	1. Fear: ChatGPT or Layoffs or Recession Panic
	2. Reward: Financial Growth or Career Growth
	4. Learning very important technology just in 3 months. Very great opportunity
3. Learning is Difficult. Manage learning as project management
	1. Most important aim 1: Finish: (Elden Ring Boss Fight)
	1. Just in time learning. (Not get caught in pre requisitve hell)
	4. moving forward at expense of less understanding, to keep time table
	5. make learning plan for weekly goals & refine plan each week
	6. Keeping time table no, matter what
4. Most important aim 2: Learning Right but how? Bloom’s Taxonomy level 7, not level 1, 2, 3. . 
	1. It is not easy to become master.. Quantifying Learning => Bloom’s Taxonomy. 
	2. Any learning is difficult actually. To form deep understanding and skill of any topic, neurons in brain connect. That’s where in long term memory, knowledge & skill lies. 
5. ~~Deep Learning as field is a combination of~~
		1. Some Maths Language
		2. Some scientific programming languages
		3. Some CS Knowledge
		4. Domain of Problem
		5. To go Deeper
			1. Psychology
			2. Neuroscience
			3. Hardware Architectures
6. Field is Nascent & Problem is very very very complex. We don’t even know 1% of replicating Natural Intelligence of Human.
			1. Software Landscape, Tools & 
			2. Research Papers and new findings
	1. Need to Self Learning
		1. ChatGPT + Bing AI
		2. Your Own customized NLP tools you can build
		3. On top of: Internet + Youtube. Great for self learning
		4. With Learning on Digital Notes
	2. ~~Start learning from 201 course & text book of the topic~~
		1. Either learn randomly
		2. Or better, learn from one graduate level course, which has organized it for us. And just learn that (first pass). So choice of course is important
		3. Then the learning process is important. You can iterate, refine, your learning. Just look again, practice wider, keep improving. Wow. It’s hard to quantify this. 
			1. May be, can define a few beginning steps. And rest can come later. Of course because nothing is planned from beginning

Note to self
Daily Plan: Follow as is. No tangents… 
1. Take one video. 
2. pass 1: Watch, take notes & make understanding video
3. pass 2: take 1 hour and make detailed video
4. Then next video
5. Tangents after finishing 1st, week’s video… 

7.

Why Logic
1. This specialization is fundamental knowledge. 
	1. Without fundamental foundation, you can’t build expertise
2. Everything is structured for learning in one place. 
3. It’s hard. But pushing through is very rewarding financially. (Boss fight.)
4. Aim of high quality of Stanford Student Projects	  
	  1. Not get caught in tangents of new interesting things hell

Maths is Language used to precisely describe deep learning
Python Programming is Language used to precisely implement deep learning equations

Intelligence is immergant


## Executive Summary
Imp
Economically Profitable
Feasible with a few skilled people + Data & Compute for Corporates. (Complex problems)
General Purpose Problem Solving. (It is applicable in any domain, at any level recursively)
Feasible for individuals too. (Low hanging fruits)
